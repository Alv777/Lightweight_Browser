## Introduction
Light Browser aims to provide an open-source fast and resource efficient browser with modern design. Using python as it's programming code we can not only achieve using the least ammount of storage, but we can also achieve fast browsing, altough this is limited for the browser engine so the C edition would be a lot faster and will probably use less storage. But for now I'm working on making the best version I can, trying to find the limitations of python and also learning on the way.
